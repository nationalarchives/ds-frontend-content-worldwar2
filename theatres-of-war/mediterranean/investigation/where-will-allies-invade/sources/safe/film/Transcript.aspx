<p>[Coroner] Bentley Purchase had particularly got somebody who had died of some respiratory thing so that it would not conflict with him having drowned, because the Germans I think and the Spaniards tried to “sus” all that out. But, they, it did seem to have received their seal of approval...</p>

<p>Not everybody in the German High Command really believed it. And that [Albert] Kesselring, who I believe was a very clever Field Marshal or whatever he was, always slightly pooh-poohed it, but the top ones apparently did, did swallow it!..</p>

<p>It had been fun, the whole way through, thinking up little things. What socks he should wear; and what nightclub he should go to and the business of his fiancé of course, who was a girl in MI5. They picked out her photograph and decided that she was a nice pretty girl who looked natural and then another girl in MI5, we were rather jealous about that, wrote the letter which is in the book. We would have liked to have written the letter but weren’t given the opportunity. This very clever girl, I don’t know who she was even, I don’t know what her name is or anything, wrote the letter, which was the affectionate letter...</p>
