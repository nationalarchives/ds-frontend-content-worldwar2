								<p>I was only told what I…exactly I needed to know. I was informed that I was going to…there would be a body. I knew it was a body when it came on board.</p>

<p>We arrived off the coast of Spain where Spain joins Portugal with the Huelva River coming down in between. And we went up towards the Huelva River at night. We were just about to surface when a fishing fleet went over the top of us, going out to collect sardines.</p>

<p>Anyway we surfaced behind them, close in shore where we thought that the eddies from the river coming out would take the body in shore. We took the end off this canister, brought the body out, checked that he’d got his papers and everything on him and then slid him over the side, went full astern on the motors so that he would be pushed in the right direction to start. I said what I could remember of the funeral service over him and then [we] secured the canister to the casing and dived and went out and at daybreak we surfaced to try and get rid of the canister because this was supposed to be meteorological equipment filling in a gap in the Meteorological Office’s equipment in London.</p>

<p>The only thing that I think was difficult is that no one except myself knew it was a body until we came to put it over the side. I then had to tell the officers because I couldn’t do the whole thing on my own.</p>
