								Operation Mincemeat was the codename for a plan masterminded by the British intelligence services to make the Germans think that the Allies were not going to invade Sicily in 1943. </p>

	<p>At first they thought it would be impossible because Sicily was by far the most sensible place to try and invade southern Europe. However, from the autumn of 1942 to the spring of 1943 a team of British intelligence officers came up with a cunning plan. They managed to get hold of the body of a man in his late thirties who had died of pneumonia. His family gave permission for the body to be used in the operation. </p>

	<p>First of all, they had to make this character seem real and believable. They created an identity pass for him and even made it look as though he had lost his original pass and was carrying a replacement one. </p>

	<p>They also had to make him seem important enough to be carrying a briefcase containing secret and highly sensitive documents. Therefore, Major Martin was given a pass to get him into Combined Operations Headquarters. This was where important politicians, officials and military commanders planned the war effort.</p>

	<p>Major Martin was to be “found” carrying the vital documents that British intelligence wanted to fall into German hands. A long letter to General Alexander appeared to give away lots of information.</p>

	<p>To avoid suspicion, Major Martin also carried a letter that explained who he was and why he was being flown over the Mediterranean. This document said that the letter intended for General Alexander was too ‘hot’ to be cabled.</p> 

	<p>By now, the British agents were beginning to believe in Major Martin themselves! They thought he would be more convincing if he had a sweetheart. As a result they persuaded one of the women who worked in their offices to become “Pam”. Major Martin carried a picture of “Pam” and a letter written by her whilst her boss, ‘the Bloodhound’, was out of the office. They added quite a few other details about the major. They even gave him an overdraft at the bank!</p>

	<p>Once all the details were ready, the dead man was dressed in the appropriate uniform for a major in the Royal Marines. He was equipped with a briefcase containing the vital documents. He was given a parachute to make it appear as if he had been in a plane. They added a few other details like coins, keys, matches, cigarettes and a belt.</p>

	<p>It was actually very important that the original man had died of pneumonia. This was because in a post mortem it would look as if he had drowned. They wanted the Germans to think Major Martin had drowned when his plane crashed in the sea. To achieve this, they built a special canister to hold his body and sailed him to the coast of Spain in a submarine. They released the body and briefcase at a place where they knew the current would carry them ashore. The British knew that a German agent operated in this area. They also knew the Spanish and the Germans were on good terms and that the Spanish would pass on all relevant information to the German agent. The Spanish handed over Major Martin’s body and his papers to the British representatives in Spain, but not before the Germans had had a good look at him and his papers first!</p>

	<p>The final touch was to give Major Martin a decent grave. The British agents arranged for British officials in Spain to have the major buried. They also visited the grave regularly. All of this reinforced the impression to the Germans that Major Martin was a real person.</p>

	<p>After the war, the Allies were able to get hold of many secret German military documents. Clearly, the information found on Major Martin was taken very seriously. In fact, even two weeks after the allied landing in Sicily, Hitler still thought that the main attack would be in Greece. He ordered his top general, Erwin Rommel, to take command of forces there. Large numbers of German troops and tanks were also moved from Italy to Greece. The German navy also spent enormous time laying new minefields off the coast of Greece. All of these efforts weakened the German defence of Sicily and helped the Allies.</p>
