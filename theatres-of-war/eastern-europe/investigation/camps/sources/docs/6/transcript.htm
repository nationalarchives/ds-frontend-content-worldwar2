								<h3>Statement by a survivor of Belsen concentration camp May 1945</h3>

							<div id="mainContent">
								<p>1. I am 27 years old and have been in concentration camps since October
1942. My only crime was being a Jew. My husband died in a concentration camp with me on 10th January 1944. I came to Belsen about January 1945<br />...</p>
<p>6. There was in the Camp a girl we knew as Stenia who was a prisoner and acted as Chief of the Camp among the prisoners. She was friendly with all the SS women and especially with Volkenrath [the Nazi in charge of the Women’s section at Belsen camp]. She was, I think, about 27 years of age, although it is difficult to tell ages in camp, very tall, slender and dark haired. She was suffering, I think, from T.B. About the beginning of April she drank something that made her ill but said that she had been poisoned by cakes sent from the kitchen. As a result the chief woman cook, her sister and a kitchen hand were shot. They disappeared and their dresses were sent back to their room which was the custom when women were shot.</p>
<p>7. The chief of the kitchen at No.1 Camp was a man whose name, I think was Traur. In the last week before the English came I saw three women ask him for drinking water which was very short in the Camp. They were in a very weak condition, I myself saw him take them one by one and drown them in a large sort of stone tank near the kitchen. They were too weak to resist and he was strong.<br />...</p>
