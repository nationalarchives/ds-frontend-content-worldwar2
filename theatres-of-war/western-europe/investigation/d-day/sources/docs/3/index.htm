								<h4>What is this source?</h4>
								<p>This is part of a report that includes interrogation statements from captured German soldiers. One of these soldiers is Polish. </p>
		
								<hr />
								<h4>What’s the background to this source?</h4>
								<p>By late 1942 the tide began to turn against Germany. From 1943 to 1944, British Empire and US forces began a build up of troops and equipment to drive the Germans out of the lands they had invaded in 1940. The landings took place in June 1944.</p>

								<div id="more2">
									<p>It may seem obvious but one of the key factors in any battle is the quality and commitment of the troops who were fighting. Many of the German troops facing the Allies at D-Day were not German. They were conscripted into the German army from territories that the Germans had conquered.</p>
								</div>				
								<hr />
								<h4>It’s worth knowing that...</h4>
								<p>There were major differences in terms of the quality of Germans troops the Allies faced on D-Day. American units faced SS Panzer Divisions on D-Day, for example, and these were well trained, well equipped, committed and very formidable opponents. However, not all German units were so committed.</p>
								<p><a href="#" class="morelink" id="more3a" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
								<div id="more3">
									<p>By 1944 the vast majority of German soldiers in the German army were fighting on the Eastern Front against the USSR. Possibly, as many as five out of six German soldiers were not German. Recruiting from occupied lands made up the numbers. As this shows, these troops were not cowards but they were not strongly committed to the German cause. </p>
								</div>				
								 <hr />
								<h4>How does this source help us to understand why D-Day was successful?</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>What is the attitude of the troops in this source?</li>
									<li>Why were the German troops in this source less committed than other German troops?</li>
									<li>Were the German troops well trained?</li>
									<li>Is it possible to say whether the role of the ground troops was more or less important than the role of the other forces on D-Day?</li>
									<li>How would you sum up the main value of this source to the historian?</li>
								</ol>				
								<ul>
									<li>Will you include this source (or part of it) in your storyboard?</li>
									<li>If you do use it, what are the main points you will make in your caption?</li>
								</ul>
