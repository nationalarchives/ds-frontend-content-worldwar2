								<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
								<p>This exhibition has a number of aims: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>To provide an animated map and commentary based introduction to each of the main theatres of war for World War 2</li>
									<li>To show a range of sources from The National Archives that few people other than academic scholars will have seen before. These have been carefully chosen for their historical significance and for their potential interest and accessibility to students </li>
									<li>To introduce students to some of the areas of controversy around specific events of World War 2</li>
									<li>To encourage students to see events from the perspective of those involved in them</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We hope to provide a resource that combines the following elements:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Depth of coverage</li>
									<li>Focus on the curriculum</li>
									<li>A highly flexible, enquiry based approach</li>
									<li>Stimulating opportunities to interpret sources and communicate ideas</li>
								</ul>
								<h3 id="exhibition">Exhibition structure</h3>
								<p>The exhibition is divided into six theatres of war. Each theatre of war is introduced using animated maps with audio commentaries and captions that relate to two phases of the war, 1939-41 and 1942-45.  The Investigations tab takes the student through to a map with a number of investigations, each of which is marked with a pin. Clicking on a pin opens the investigation for that topic.</p>
								<p>Each investigation is designed so that it can be used as a 'stand alone' item in one or two classroom sessions. However, taken altogether, the investigations in a given theatre of war are linked to form a more coherent area of research. </p>
								<p>The exhibition is ideal for group work or personalised learning. Groups in the classroom could work on different theatres of war and their investigations reporting back to the class as a whole or they can use the material individually for project or homework.</p>
								<p>Lastly, the exhibition can be navigated in a different way from the homepage by going directly to the <strong>Index of Resources</strong>, which provides links to all the investigations in each theatre and all source files used within that investigation. The Index of Resources allows all the resources to be reached easily without having to go to a particular investigations map within a given theatre. </p>
								<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
								<h3 id="investigations">Investigations structure</h3>
								<p>Clicking on an investigation will reveal a <strong>box of sources</strong>. On the page there is a brief description of the task for a particular investigation. For more information pupils click on the link called <strong>Introduction: starter sources</strong>. This page details the task and provides an opening source that is significant for the investigation. Students can then "open" the <strong>source box</strong> for the investigation. This is a collection of different sources including: documents, maps, film, paintings or audio files. It is important to note that students can explore these sources in <strong><em>any order</em></strong> they chose after looking at the starter source. </p>
								<p>We have structured the exhibition in this non-linear way to give the students a real sense of working as a historian. In another words they have to sift through the evidence and decide the sequence of their investigation. This approach can also support a wider range of different learning styles and greater differentiation and flexibility.  For example some students may prefer to start with a photograph or a watch a film clip before looking at a document that they may perceive as more difficult. Of course, teachers may wish to prompt their students to navigate the sources in a particular order by previously book-marking certain source pages.</p>
								<p>While some of the original sources used here are very accessible (images and simple documents), others are more challenging. To help with this we have provided all sources with audio transcripts and text transcripts as appropriate. </p>
								<p>We hope these features will provide further opportunities for differentiation when using the exhibition with mixed ability groups. The use of sound will also perhaps encourage pupils to engage more with the topic and help them to appreciate the differences in language, expression and ideas. There is also a global glossary for the site.</p>
								<p>All sources can be enlarged by clicking on them or by using the enlarge button on the web page. Some sources also have a zoomify feature so allow students to take a really close look at the evidence, notably the maps. This is where standard enlargement is not sufficient. </p>
								<p>Finally, all sources are supported by background information designed to give some context to the sources studied. There are questions to encourage students to interpret the original source. Downloadable worksheets, tables or presentation software templates are also available to help them record their ideas for the task at hand. Downloable pdfs are available for all investigations and individual sources.</p>

								<h3 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h3>
								<p>This exhibition is intended for the history National Curriculum at Key Stage 3.</p>
								<p>KS3 Unit 18: Hot war, cold war: why did the major twentieth-century conflicts affect so many people? The unit focuses on the widespread impact of these conflicts through the examination of specific events, the personal experiences of individuals and a wide range of visual and written sources.</p>
								<p>The exhibition is also appropriate for the GCSE modern world history courses at Key stage 4 as examined by Edexcel, OCR and AQA.</p>
